				Reflective introduction
			</h2>		
			<p>
				The process of making portfolio was challenging as well as educational experience. The following are the topics as well as the lessons that I got through to make this portfolio. 
			</p>	
				<h2> Wireframe</h2>
			<p> 
				First of all, I began by outlining the website's structure and layout. After that I created a wireframe for each tabs which included home(index),project, contact, video_demo and site_report at last. By doing so it made easier for me to see the general layout and ensure a consistent look across the site.
			</p>

				<h2>
					HTML structure 
				</h2>
			<p>
				I started by putting on a basic html format across each page. Setting up a semantic html tags like header, nav, section and footer was important for enhancing both readability and acessibility.
			</p>
				<h2>
					CSS styling
				</h2>
			<p>
				After I was done with html structure, I used css to style the pages. I ensure to share same style of navigation links and background-color throughout my all pages. I also used flex and css grid to allow me to create responsive layouts which ensures the positive impact on both users in desktop and mobile. 
			</p>
				
				<h2>
					Responsive design and layout
				</h2>
			<p>
				Making the website responsive was challenging to attain. In responsive design, it was hard to switch the menu in vertical layout and sometimes it wasn't functioning properly. But somehow manage to sort out the problem. Especially on responsive layouts, image alignments and grid item responsiveness showed layout problems while testing on several devices. The css needed to be heavily adjusted in order to resolve both responsiv design and layouts.
			</p>
				<h2>
					Github version control
				</h2>

			<p>
				The github version control taught me the essence of regular commits. The practice of it helped me to manage and complete the project in a efficient manner and made tracking changes easier.
			</p>

				<h2>
					Conclusion
				</h2>

			<p>
				At last, this project helped me become much more proficient in HTML5, CSS3 and responsive design. It also gave me insightful knowledge regarding code validation and control. With this experiecnce now I am  confident that I will make less mistakes compared to this and excited to make another website.
